            Fine Dining in Sligo here are certain characteristics that we believe to achieve.
            A good restaurant ets a high standard for its food quality and taste.
            The food is classic with a contemporary twist and offers everything you could 
            possibly want.  All of the local seafood is hand-selected and artistically prepared 
            to perfection. All of the steak cuts stand tall with the superb flavour of aged beef 
            that is cooked to your liking.  Produce is organic whenever possible, sourced from 
            local suppliers and direct form local producers.
